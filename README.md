This demo programm (App SDK) uses integrated Windows runtime functions to access, connect and exchange data with Proteus radio modules. 
It deliberately chooses not to use any 3rd party software that is not available for free to the public, even if it is known that Windows runtime functions does only provide rudimenary functionality.

The Demo uses WPF in combination with .NET core 3.1.

#### This App is no "driver" for supporting a Bluetooth Classic like SPP profile to COM port! It is a DEMO application showing the use of proteus modules with their RX and TX profiles for generic data with Microsoft Windows 10.


This App SDK implements the required methods to:
* Scan for devices, including filters (UUID, RSSI) and listing of scan results
* Connect to one of the found devices
* Enable notifications in case of a connection (required for communication direction "from proteus" to this App)
* Exchange data with a Proteus device using the Proteus's integrated charactersitics for data exchange (RX and TX charactersitic).
* Perform in-App bonding + pairing during a connection according to Proteus "bonding + static passkey" (e.g. used in peripheral only mode) and "bonding + just works" security method using the proteus default key.
* Perform in-App unbonding / unpairing of a connected device during disconnect.
* Detect the max. user payload that can be used for the active connection

Known Limitations of Windows 10 Runtime API for Bluetooth Low Energy:
* An API to perform a clean + instantaneous disconnect is not available. Disconnect on Windows side is performed by letting the connection time-out.
* An API to trigger the change of the Bluetooth LE PHY layer (LE coded or 2MBit) is not existing. However when the module uses this function and the PC bluetooth chipset supports it (i.e. Bluetooth 5.0 or newer) the 2Mbit PHY can be used.
* An API "OnPhyUpdate" is not existing, so the App can be notified in case of an update when triggered by the proteus.
* An API "GetBluetoothVersion" is not existing. So users cannot check for the available Bluetooth (LE) Version programmatically when using the Windows RT API for Bluetooth.
* Windows API does not support pairing without bonding. This means when the Proteus RF_SecFlags setting is 0x03 the connection to the windows PC will fail (the in app pairing will not work: error - handler not registered), but when bonding is enabled in addtion to static passkey (i.e. RF_SecFlags 0x0B, as seen in Peripheral only mode per default), the in-app pairing is working. 
* Windows API does currently not provide access to LESC (le secure connection) functions and mehtods.
* Windows API does not support sending of multiple packets per connection intervall. The max. End-to-End throughput is expected to show this limitation (i.e.: a max.: 1 frame of 243 byte user payload per 7.5ms when using BLE 4.2 or newer in the PC). However reception of multiple packets per intervall seems to be working.
* Windows Bonding information (in the Windows Bluetooth manager) cannot be removed from the App

#### Caution: Bluetooth Version 3.5 or older does not include Bluetooth Low Energy standard yet. Hence it does not support communication with any BLE device. Bluetooth 4.1 and 4.0 only support 19 byte of user payload as defined in the Standard. Bluetooth 4.2 and newer may support  larger user payload per packet (support is optional).


## Requirements (for compiling)

* Windows 10, Build 1809 or newer.
* Visual Studio 2019
* .NET core 3.1 SDK or newer.
* Windows SDK Version 10.0.18362.0 or newer.isual Studio 2019
* .NET framework 4.7 or newer
* A Windows 10 compatible Bluetooth Low Energy Hardware available to the PC (recommended: Bluetooth 4.2 or newer). This device will show up in the device manager as "Generic Bluetooth Radio" and as "Microsoft Bluetooth LE Enumerator".


## Requirements (for running the published packet)

* Windows 10, Build 1809 or newer.
* .NET core 3.1 runtime or newer.
* .NET framework 4.7 runtime or newer
* A Windows 10 compatible Bluetooth Low Energy Hardware available to the PC (recommended: Bluetooth 4.2 or newer). This device will show up in the device manager as "Generic Bluetooth Radio" and as "Microsoft Bluetooth LE Enumerator".

# Using the Windows 10 Runtime & SDK, Notes:

Check and/or add dependencie(s) to your project:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\UnionMetadata\[version]\Windows.winmd in visual studio project references to use Windows.Devices.Bluetooth and dependant subclasses,
[version] is for example "10.0.19041.0" can differ on your installation, 10.0.18362.0 is the smallest supported Windows 10 SDK revision that was tested with this sources.  
The .csproj project file implements autodetection of Versons "10.0.19041.0"  and "10.0.18362.0".

To make this file "Windows.winmd"  available the Windows 10 SDK (Version 10.0.18362.0 or newer) must be installed. Download here (or use vs installer): https://developer.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/

To make this programm compile in visual studio, installing .net core SDK 3.1 is required. Download here (or use vs installer): https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

Refert to: https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/using-winrt-apis-from-desktop-applications.html for use of the Windows Runtime in c# and c++ projects.

#### Caution: Bluetooth maximum transfer unit (MTU) and physical data unit (PDU) is not equal to the maximum possible radio packet size or user payload size per radio packet. Large packets may casue fragmentation Due to Protocol overheads a max. user payload of 243 byte per radio frame is supported by Proteus. Windows may apply fragmentation if the available Bleutooth LE hardware does not support large radio frames.
